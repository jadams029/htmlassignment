    <h1>My Favorite X-Men Storyline</h1>
    <h2>X-Men Age Of Apocalypse</h2>
    <p>The X-Men Age of Apocalypse storyline involved (spoilers) the death of Charles Xavier, The Head of The Xavier Institue for Gifted Children. 
        Upon his unintentional death by his son David Haller, aka Legion, an entirely new timeline was created where Apocalypse ruled over the world and many of the X-Men developed new loyalties in this new timeline.
        This tiemline was created when David traveled back in time to kill Magneto, but he went to far back to a time when Xavier and Magneto were still friends.
        Charles sacrifieced himself to save Magneto thus causing David to never have existed, fracturing the current timeline to peices and creating the new one. 
        Needless to say this was a very unique scenario in which beloved heroes were now villians and vice verse.
        Fun times indeed for many.
